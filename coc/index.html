<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>We intend to protect all members of our community from harassment and to ensure that our community is as welcoming and inclusive as possible. This document contains the rules and principles for participating in our platform. This is a working document, so our team may amend it from time to time.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Provide a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone regardless of gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, political affiliation, or other similar characteristics.</li>
<li>Create a supportive community where people freely share their passions and are excited and optimistic about each other's successes.</li>
<li>Protect our community from harassment, malicious or illegal content, and individual members whose goals are to disrupt our community and promote their own self-interest at the expense of the community.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Principles that Guide us</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>We are not a free speech zone.</strong> This CoC lays out expected standards of conduct and behavior. You cannot say or post anything violating these rules or principles and remain a community member. You must follow this CoC. If you are looking for something else, please do. It is not here.</li>
<li><strong>The Moderators are not morality or thought police.</strong> Moderators are guided by this Code of Conduct. Post what you want if what you post follows these rules, principles, and the goals outlined above. Not every community member will appreciate controversial or explicit posts, so use Content Warnings liberally. We use Content Warnings so community members themselves can decide whether they want to see or engage with a post that may be controversial or explicit.</li>
<li><strong>Bullies, trolls, and disruptors</strong> are not welcome in our community. We will moderate accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>This is a voluntary community. You chose to be here.</strong> When you decide to join, you have implied that you agree with this Code of Conduct and will follow it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rules for posting</h2>
<p>The rules you need to follow if you want to be a member of our community are stated below.</p>
<h3>General guidance on posting and participating in this community</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not post about inflammatory, controversial subjects without a Content Warning.</strong> Ideally, you would not post about provocative topics at all. However, it may be acceptable to do so in some cases. Still, posting inflammatory content without hiding the content behind an appropriate Content Warning is never good.</li>
<li><strong>Do not post any nudity without a Content Warning.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Regarding Spam: We are not your free advertising platform.</strong> You will be removed if you are here only to sell your products or services. Occasional posts of commercial links are OK, but when most of a user's posts are commercial, we regard the account as Spam account. Moderators will evaluate reports of Spam on a case-by-case basis.</li>
<li><strong>Do not engage in name-calling</strong>, <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ad%20hominem">ad hominem attacks</a>, or other uncivil behavior. Criticize ideas, never people.</li>
<li><strong>Do not report every post that upsets you.</strong> Please report posts that violate our rules but for others that you may find distasteful or don't like, use the tools available to you. You can block the user or mute the conversation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Moderation Principles</h2>
<p>Reported content will be assessed on a balance of probabilities by the moderators. In other words, whether it's more likely than not that the content violates one or more of these rules. Moderators will suspend an account from this community when the user demonstrates that they have breached any rule several times or if their content (including profile description) suggests that they are likely to continue to break the rules. The number of breaches leading to suspension is deliberately not defined. In egregious cases, one violation can result in suspending the user account.</p>
<p>The moderation team takes a pragmatic approach to every report they receive - if they feel that a problematic post isn't explicitly a breach of any of these rules but is inappropriate for this community, the post will likely be removed. Users who repeatedly post problematic content or are seen by the moderators as a negative, disruptive presence in our community can be removed at the moderation team's discretion, even if those posts or the user did not explicitly violate our rules.</p>
