<p>Here at toot.community, we value your privacy and peace of mind over everything else. That's why we promise not to display advertisements or sell your data. Instead, we operate on the goodwill and generous contributions of our members.</p>

If you enjoy our services and have an account with us, we kindly ask you to consider supporting us financially.</p>
<p>Every bit helps us maintain our independence and ensures that we can continue to provide a secure, ad-free platform for everyone hosted on this instance. It provides a measure of financial security and helps us keep this wonderful community thriving.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can donate:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://ko-fi.com/jorijn">Support via Ko-Fi</a> - Accepts payments through Credit Card, PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. As a token of our gratitude, everyone who donates through Ko-Fi receives a special shoutout on our <a href="https://toot.community/@funding">@funding</a> account.</li>
